Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories:
    -> Inventories contain large amount of products in them to store and retrive their information
        data structures are crucial.We can retrive data at O(1) complexity by using hashmaps as 
        they hash and store data which can be retrived efficiently and duplicates can be avoided

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem:
    -> We can have multiple approaches,Here I create 2 user defined types Product to store products
       information and Inventory to store Products(In Inventory I use HashMap to store products with
       respect to productId)

Time complexity:
    -> since we are using hashmap for all operations it is O(1)

Optimization:
    -> For this simple implementation this solution is optimal,If we considered to implement it
       we need to consider safety in concurrent operations and to make if efficient we can implement
       caching.
